<h1>A little about me</h1>
<br>
My name is Toni Conn. I'm a Michigan based fitness and nutrition enthusiast and all around nerd. I'm passionate about the nuances of fitness and nutrition. I'm currently working through my own healing journey regarding histamine intolerance and leaky gut.
<br>
By day, I work as an Accounts Payable Clerk, and on the side I share weekly what I'm learning about fitness and nutrition, as well as my healing journey, on my Instagram. I'm also going to school for my accounting degree and to get my CPA.
<br>
In my spare time, I love to spend time with friends and family watching shows and movies. I plan to become a personal trainer and nutrition coach on the side in the future.
